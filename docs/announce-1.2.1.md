Configgy is a library for handling config files and logging for a scala
daemon. The idea is that it should be simple and straightforward, allowing you
to plug it in and get started quickly, writing small useful daemons without
entering the shadowy world of java frameworks.


Changes in version 1.2.1 include:

  - a few bug fixes related to case-insensitive key names (thanks to Jesse
    Eichar)
  - RuntimeEnvironment loads build-revision


It can't be a project without a website, so that's here:

And, for fans of maven/ivy, you can add this to your repository list to
get configgy versions:
